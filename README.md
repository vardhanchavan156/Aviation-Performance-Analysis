ðŸ“Œ Overview
In the highly competitive airline industry, maximizing profitability is influenced by multiple operational and financial factors.
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model that accurately predicts Profit (USD) for flights while also providing actionable insights through Power BI dashboards for better decision-making.

ðŸš€ Objectives
âœ… Build a robust ML model to predict airline profitability.
âœ… Analyze key features such as:
Flight Delays
Aircraft Utilization
Turnaround Time
Load Factor
Fleet Availability
Maintenance Downtime
Fuel Efficiency
Revenue & Operating Costs
âœ… Provide explainability and business insights.
âœ… Visualize operational metrics and performance using Power BI.

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model
âœ… Model Used: Ridge Regression
ðŸŽ¯ Performance:
RÂ² Score: .762
MAE: 0.0000
RMSE: 0.0000
